# Contributing Guidelines

First of all, thanks for considering to help this project. Any help is appreciated, as long as you follow these simple guidelines.

## Responding to issues

Consider visiting the Issues tab to see what's missing and where help is due.
You'll need a decent understanding of Angular before diving deep, so check out the good first issues first.

## Raising issues

You can try the demo available at https://bglamadrid.github.io/trebol-ng/ to test all functionalities.
You can suggest additions and changes to your heart's content, but do it in good faith.

Good faith mostly means that:
* All issues have a clear intention on their title, and a reasonable description, if needed.
* Any issue does not rely on another, unless it's stated clearly.

Some issues that are yet to be raised are:
* Documenting: part of the codebase may not be clear enough, be it classes, functions, service methods...
* Splitting functionality: some components may be too complex for their own good
* Infrastructure: the project may be easier to understand if different directory layouts are used
* Contributing guidelines: this file may be improved in some way
