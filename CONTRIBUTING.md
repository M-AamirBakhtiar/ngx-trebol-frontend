# Contributing Guidelines

## Existing issues

Consider visiting the Issues tab first, to see *where* help is due.
If you're not strictly familiar with Angular, you can still give a look at those good first issues.


## Raising issues

You can suggest additions and changes to [the demo](https://trebol-ecommerce.github.io/ngx-trebol-frontend/). Also, trying to find bugs and report anything that seems strange or recurrently malfunctioning is another way to give me a helping hand.

Specify where and what is the issue, and what did you do to reproduce it.


I'm also not very good at writing contributing guidelines like these, so for now I stick to simplicity. You can lend me a hand here as well.
