# Contributing Guidelines

First of all, thanks for considering to help this project. Any help is appreciated, as long as you follow these simple guidelines.

## Responding to issues

Consider visiting the Issues tab to see what's missing and where help is due.
You'll need a decent understanding of Angular before diving deep, but there are good first issues where you can help, too.

## Raising issues

Jasmine tests are currently being developed, and the demo in https://bglamadrid.github.io/ngx-trebol-frontend/ may fail at certain points. You can report any bug or error you find.If you wish, you can suggest additions and changes, I only ask to do it in good faith (see below).

### 'Good faith' rules

There can be exceptions to these rules, but I'd like you to keep them in mind whenever possible.

1. Atomicity: Any issue does not rely on another. If an issue implies many changes, try to divide it into smaller ones.
2. Clarity: All issues should be understood solely by reading their title, and posess a reasonable description, if needed.
