# Trébol (Spanish Clover), The Virtual Web Store

Trébol was born as a grown-up version of a hardware store web system called 'FERME Web'. Initially I created an Angular dashboard application that connected to a REST API-assisted backend service, that could list all the content stored in a MySQL database. 
That functionality, and the boilerplate code associated, sits at the core of this project, which aims to implement every good practice to deliver an online vending system with all the industry-standard functionalities that end-users are accustomed to.
